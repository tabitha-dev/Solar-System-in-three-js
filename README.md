🌌 Solar System Simulation – Explore the Cosmos with Three.js 🚀
An interactive, modern web-based project to explore the solar system in 3D. This project emphasizes core web development skills like 3D rendering, animation, and user interaction while providing an immersive experience of our cosmic neighborhood.

🔥 Features at a Glance
🪐 Explore the Planets, One Orbit at a Time!
🌞 Realistic Sun: A glowing sun at the center of the solar system.

🪐 Planetary Orbits: Watch planets orbit the sun with accurate relative distances.

🌀 Rotating Planets: Each planet rotates on its axis for added realism.

🪐 Rings of Saturn and Uranus: Detailed rings for these gas giants.

🌌 Starry Background: A stunning backdrop of stars to enhance the cosmic experience.

✨ Pinch-to-Zoom: Interactive zooming for a closer look at planets.

🖥️ How to Run
